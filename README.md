# wsl-git

wsl-git is a utility for integration with git UI such as SourceTree, the workaround the problem that
Windows' version of git is very slow against repo in \\wsl$\.  It forwards the git commands issued
by SourceTree etc. to the git running in WSL which is fast.

*It's still a work-in-progress and under testing.  After it stabilizes, usage steps will be added.*
